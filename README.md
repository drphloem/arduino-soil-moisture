##Soil moisture with vegetronix soil moisture probes

This code was part of a project to build a soil moisture sensor using an Arduino Uno and [Vegetronix](https://www.vegetronix.com) soil moisture sensor. I added an [LCD shield from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/772) to display the soil moisture and voltage read from the soil moisture probe. The VWC is calculated using the piecewise regression provided on the vegetronix website, but can be customized for your soil using instructions from Vegetronix.
